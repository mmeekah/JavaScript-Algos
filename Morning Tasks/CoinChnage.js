// Generate Coin Change
// Change is inevitable (especially when breaking a twenty). Make generateCoinChange(cents).
// Accept a number of American cents, computer and print how to represent that amount with smallest number of coins. Common American coins are pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents).

// Example output, given (94):
// 94 cents can be represented by:
// quarters: 3
// dimes: 1
// nickels: 1
// pennies: 4

// Second: can you simplify/shorten your code?

// Third: add half-dollar (50 cents) and dollar (100 cents) coins with 40 additional characters or less.â€©
